- Adaptive Instance Normalization

Basic Idea is to align the pixelwise statistics between content and style image feature maps. Use pretrained VGG-19 for VGG Encoder and mostly mirrored architecture for Decoder, mainly with batch normalization layers removed. The details are stated in the paper.



- Content and Style Loss

  - Content Loss

    - Euclidean distance between bottleneck feature maps. This refers to the reconstruction loss.

  - Style Loss

    ![image-20210109150225621](/asset/images/loss3.jpg)

    - Euclidean distance between feature map statistics from relu_1_1, relu_2_1, relu_3_1, relu_4_1. This assures that two moments of transformed image and original style images be close.

- (Note) Original paper is officially implemented in lua.
